# MapPinTimers

A WoW Addon.

- Calculates how long until you reach a map pin based on your current speed.
- Displays the travel time remaining under the distance remaining.
- Auto-tracks newly placed map pins.
- Ensures the map pins will always be at full opacity at any distance so the timer can be seen.
