# MapPinTimers

A WoW Addon.

Calculates how long until you reach a map pin based on your current speed. Displays the travel time remaining under the distance remaining.

It is highly recommended you install Unlimited Map Pin Distance alongside this addon to see pins further than 1000 yards away, although it is not required.
